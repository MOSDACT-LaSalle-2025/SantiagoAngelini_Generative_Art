Name: Box Shifters

Description: A room where different size boxes shift front to back 

rotating on x and y at a determined angle speed, leaving their 

previous move printed. They appear in different size, color and XY 

coordinates every time they reach the Z limit of the room. The 

lights change when the whole image refreshes, but it refreshes 

randomly after x number of boxes. This is a generative piece because 

it has different variables that change on each iteration like: 

-The dimensions of the box

-The location of the starting point of the box

-The color of the light

-The location of the light

-The quantity of boxes before refreshing
